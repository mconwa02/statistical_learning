and to replace the coding examples with Python instead of R

The website for this book is located at 

www.StatLearning.com

The data sets used in the book are from the R libraries ISLR and MASS.
The SKlearn and StatsModels packages were used to obtain the same datasets

However some packages did not contain the data from the Rdatasets:
